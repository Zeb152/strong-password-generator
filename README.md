# strong password gen
 Makes an easy way to generate strong passwords.

 You can use this script with the shortcuts app on Mac, just by making a shortcut that runs a shell script that in turn runs the python script. You can then set up a keybind that runs the shortcut, which in my case is cmd+option+p. The link for the shortcut is below or just take a look at the screenshot of the Shortcut.
